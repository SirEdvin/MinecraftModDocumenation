Cables seems a little obsolete now, in real world you can freely use wireless transfer (even for energy and items), why this shouldn't work in Minecraft? So, here is goes peripheral proxy, nice tool to connect remote peripherals to the computer without actual wires. Sadly it has limited range, but how is ideal today?

## How to configure

To configure peripheral proxy, you can use [ultimate configurator](ultimate_configurator.md). 

## Supported APIs

- `peripheral_hub` api for CC:T, so this upgrade actually work as modem and provide access to peripherals inside it.
