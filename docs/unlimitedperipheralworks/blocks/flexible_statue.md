Flexible statues are blocks that can be altered by [Statue workbench](statue_workbench.md) to mimic another block, be player- or light-passable, or even be invisible!

Flexible statues store information when you break them and also allow you to manipulate this information via crafting table:
- Putting an altered, flexible statue on the crafting table alone allows you to clean it up.
- Putting altered flexible statues with some empty flexible statues on the crafting table allows you to copy them.
