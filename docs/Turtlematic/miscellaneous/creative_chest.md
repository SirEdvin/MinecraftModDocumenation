| generate(item: string, count: number, nbtData: string?) | [Result](introduction.md#result)  | Tries to put required item with required count into turtle inventory |

> [!tip]- How in hell does nbtData works?
> NBT data passing from ComputerCraft to Minecraft are ... complicated task. So currently, `nbtData` are just string that expected to be minecraft NBT data serialized into json. 
> You can try `generate("minecraft:potion", 1, "{Potion:\"minecraft:long_regeneration\"}")` to understand how it works
