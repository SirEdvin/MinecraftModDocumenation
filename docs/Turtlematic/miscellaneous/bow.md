Maybe someone had a dream about turtle, finally shooting items from a bow? Well, now this dream come true. This turtle now capable of sending any items to the sky (or little closer).

If the item hits any block or entity with inventory, it will be automatically stored in it. If the item is an arrow, it will be shot as an arrow from the dispenser.

Of course, the item can just hit the ground and after some time will be available to pickup as a regular item on the ground.
