??? info "Supported versions"
    **Forge**: 1.19.4
    **Fabric**: 1.19.4

Turtle limited to two upgrade slots and pocket computers to one. With all this nasty new add-ons to CC:T it sometimes becomes a pain to select what upgrade you want to install. But with this hub, you can install all of them! 

Nah, unfortunately, only 3 for base version and 7 for netherite one, but this is still something. And of course, both turtles and pocket computers are supported!

!!! danger
    Due to ComputerCraft limitations, all equipped upgrades will be deleted if you brake turtle or remove peripheralium hub without unequipping upgrades

## Supported APIs

- [Configuration API](configuration.md)
- `peripheral_hub` api for CC:T, so this upgrade actually work as modem and provide access to peripherals inside it.
