Flexible reality anchors are blocks that can be altered by [Reality forger](reality_forger.md) to mimic another block, be player- or light-passable, or even be invisible!

Flexible reality anchors store information when you break them and also allow you to manipulate this information via crafting table:
- Putting an altered, flexible reality anchor on the crafting table alone allows you to clean it up.
- Putting altered flexible reality anchor with some empty flexible reality anchors on the crafting table allows you to copy it.
