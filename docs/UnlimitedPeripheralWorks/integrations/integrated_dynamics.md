[Integrated Dynamics](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/integrated-dynamics) is a mod that requires you to build networks for complex automation and system integration. It is a mix between bundled redstone, BuildCraft gates, and Applied Energistics-style networks.

Integration with Integrated Dynamics splits into two parts:
- Get information from Integrated Dynamics into CC:T
- Send information from CC:T to Integrated Dynamics

## Extracting data from Integrated Dynamics

For this goal, you can use Variable Store from Integrated Dynamics. By default, this store serves as a generic inventory. Integration modifies generic inventory methods to take variables into account.

For example, if you run `list()`, you will receive enriched output

```lua
{
    id = 1,
    type = "nbt",
    isDynamic = false,
    label = "MyCuteVariable"
}
```

To get the actual variable value, you can use `getItemDetail(slot: int)` method, which will calculate and return information about the variable in the required slot

```lua
{
    id = 0,
    type = "nbt",
    isDynamic = false,
    label = "MyCuteVariable",
    value = {
        v = {
            ["test.lua"] = "THERE IS NO DATA HERER"
        }
    }
}
```

## Sending data to Integrated Dynamics network

Integration also provides a specific aspect for Machine Reader, called "Directory inside computer". This output has an NBT type and will read data from any file inside "/integrateddynamics" folder in the target computer and return it to the ID network as an NBT. All files should be utf-8 encoded.

!!! note "Example output"
    ```json
    {
        "file_name_1": "file_content_1",
        "file_name_2": "file_content_2"
    }
    ```
