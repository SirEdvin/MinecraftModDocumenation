| scheduleSearch(biome: string) | [Result](introduction.md#result) | Tries to run search for specific biome id. Will fail if another search is not finished yet |
| getState()                    | string                           | Returns current search state, which can be one of INACTIVE, SEARCHING, FOUND, NOT_FOUND         |
| getResult()                   | table                            | Returns information about found biome or nil, if no biome found                            |

!!! note

    The result of the search is position and facing dependent as in [Scan API](scan.md). You don't need to re-run the search after changing position or facing, coordinates will update automatically on the next `getResult()` function call.
