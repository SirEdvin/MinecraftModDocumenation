# Types and definitions

This section of documentation will describe everything about APIs, that can be provided by different peripherals and general information how to read function tables.

Take a note, that some peripherals (actually, a lot of them) will have extra functions besides supported APIs.

## Parameters description

Functions defined like `call_name(required_arg_1: arg_type_1, required_arg_2: arg_type_2, optional_arg: arg_type_3)`. Some types will have additional limitations, like "only positive numbers", or "only numbers in specific range". In case when limitations are not met, function will throw exception.

## New data types

Mostly this sections contains enums, that are need to be passed as strings. Enums are case-insensetive, so you can pass them as you want.

| Name                | Lua type         | Limitations                           |
|---------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| interactionMode     | string           | Enum with values: any, block, entity  |
| areaInteractionMode | string           | Enum with values: item, block, entity |
| direction           | string           | Enum with values: up, down            |
| Result              | boolean, string? | -                                     |
| Result[T]           | T?, string?      | -                                     |

### Interaction mode

All functions, that accept _interactionMode_ as arguments, work with objects in line of sight. They will take as target the first object, that they found. You can force this functions to work only with blocks, or only with entities.

!!! info
    You can get available _interactionMode_ for specific APIs on peripheral documentation page. All available values is `both`, `entity` and `block`

!!! warning
    Pretty important to note that a lot of entity interaction will be limited to specific entities. For example, Husbandry Automata Core allows to works only with animals. Always checks peripheral documentation page to understand its limitation with entities.

### Area interaction mode

All functions, that accept _areaInteractionMode_ as arguments, work with objects in specific radius around it. You can get this radius via `getConfiguration()` method. Use this parameter to select what objects should to used for operation.

!!! info
    You can get available _areaInteractionMode_ for specific APIs on peripheral documentation page. All available values is `item`, `entity` and `block`

!!! warning
    Pretty important to note that a lot of entity interaction will be limited to specific entities. For example, Husbandry Automata Core allows to works only with animals. Always checks peripheral documentation page to understand its limitation with entities.

### Direction

All functions, that accept _direction_ as arguments, work with objects in line of sight. You can use this argument to change line of sight and fake peripheral player will begin to start to look down (or up).

### Result

_Result_ are always representing result of called operation. First argument will tell you is operation was successful and second one will tell you reason why operation is failed.

_Result_ can also be parametrized, for example as `Result[number]`, which means it will return operation result as first argument (or nil) and as second argument it will tell you reason why operation is failed.


### ItemQuery

!!! warning
    Before 1.19.4, ItemQuery type did not exist, so instead of it you can use only the string version of this argument

ItemQuery is a powerful argument, that is supposed to help you build filters for items, extracting them in a more precise way, than just item ID.

You can pass to an argument, that has type ItemQuery a string, and it will become just a regular item ID filter. 

But you can also pass a table

```lua
{
    nbt = "<item nbt hash>",
    tag = "minecraft:lapis_ores",
    displayName = "Deepslate Lapis Lazuli Ore",
    name = "minecraft:deepslate_lapis_ore"
}
```

A table can have zero or more keys and all of them will be required from the item at once. So, for example, if you want to search for a written book with the name "Small and Big Owls", you can pass next itemQuery

```lua
{
    name = "minecraft:written_book",
    displayName = "Small and Big Owls"
}
```


### BlockPos

BlockPos is just generic table with three requied fields - x, y and z. So, something of this will be enough:

```lua
{
    x = 5,
    y = 7,
    z = 8
}
```

!!! warning
    In most cases block pos is expected to be relative to the target peripheral like in [scan API](scan.md)'
