# SirEdvin's Cloud Solutions

Tired of too bare metal world of CC:T? What your own database to be reliable no matter what[^2]? What some block draw charts for you[^1]? Then get ready for SirEdvin's Cloud solutions, mod that designed to provide you with all this crap:

- Open yourself to a bunch of cross-dimensional cloud databases: KV and Timeseries[^3]
- Server owners can allow uses to build their dashboards on top of cloud databases, that would be accessable from real world[^3]
- Ask server owners to configure StatsD bridge and send metrics from your computers to real worlds
- And much more to come, if you have ideas, please, open an [issue](https://github.com/SirEdvin/CloudSolutions/issues/new)
