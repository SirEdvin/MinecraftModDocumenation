# Documentation for SirEdvin's minecraft mods

This is main repository for documentation for my mods, related to minecraft (and mostly ComputerCraft addons right now).

## Working on documentation

So, initial version of this documentation is Obsidian-based vault, so there is some stranges with format and edit it outside of Obsidian logic can be a little tricky.

### Specific tricks for documentation

Use this for nice side floating image:

```html
<span class="describeimg">![[powered_rail.png]]</span>
```

Use this to force every floating image render and clear page

```html
<br class="clearBoth" />
```
